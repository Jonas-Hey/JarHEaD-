== Cache management ==

{{PRODUCT}} uses multiple caches to improve the system performance at runtime. 

[[Admin:Cache|Admin:Cache]] provides a UI to manage those caches (e.g. to manually invalidate the cache contents).

=== Managed Caches ===

The ''managed caches'' table lists all globally managed caches of {{PRODUCT}} and shows certain properties (e.g. the number of entries or the cache size) as well as actions.

Caches (and their functionality) are distinguished by their type (i.e. ''Cache'', ''Map'', ''Collection'', etc.). For all types the current number of entries is shown. Additionally, caches of type ''Cache'' allow to measure special statistics (like hit rate or miss count). This functionality is deactivated by default to avoid computational overhead, but can be activated for analysis at runtime, see details below.

The following actions are available for managed caches

* ''invalidation'': this action invalidates the cache using the type specific strategy. For caches of type ''Cache'' the cache is cleared, while internal state such as statistics are kept. For other types the entire cache is removed and it gets recreated upon next access to the cache.
* ''removal'': this actions removes the cache from the cache manager. Upon next access, the cache gets recreated
* ''info'': shows additional information about the cache in a popup (e.g. its content)
* ''activate statistics'' (expert feature): allows to activate statistics for caches of type ''Cache''. After activation the respective caches have to be explicitly removed and recreated using the ''removal'' functionality. This recreates the cache with the statistics module activated. After a restart of {{PRODUCT}} the statistics module is deactivated.
* ''calculate cache size'': computes the size of all objects in the respective cache. This may give an indication of the memory footprint of the cache. Since the computation is performance intensive, it can be triggered on-demand (while the computed values are cached). Note that the computed size of a cache is an estimation only and the value may deviate from the actual size.

=== Special Caches ===

In the ''special caches'' tab there are functions to invalidate special caches, e.g. the label cache, ACL cache or the query catalog.

Using the respective button invalidates the cache.

=== DBIndex ===

DB Index is a special cache which for certain in-memory objects. Particularly this is relevant for quick access to infrastructure objects (e.g. from eCloudManager). Using the ''Clear DBIndexes'' button the caches can be invalidated.
