== Local users ==

The table below lists all local users with their corresponding groups. New users can be created and assigned groups.
You can select group names from existing roles or define your own groups and map these to roles using [[Admin:Permissions]].
Note: in order to provide access to many users, an external identity management system should be used. See [[Help:UserManagement|the manual]] for details.
