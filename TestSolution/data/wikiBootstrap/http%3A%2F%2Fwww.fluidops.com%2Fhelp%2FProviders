=== Data Provider Concept ===
Data providers are configurable programs that connect to remote data sources (such as files, Web endpoints, or legacy systems), extract data from these sources, convert it into the RDF data format (where necessary), and store the extracted data in the {{PRODUCT}}'s local repository. The {{PRODUCT}} comes with a variety of predefined data providers for integrating data from RDF files or web pages, SPARQL endpoints (based on SPARQL <i>CONSTRUCT</i> queries that extract the relevant subset of information from the endpoints, CSV and XML files, as well as Relational Databases. As such, they hide the complexity from the data integration process and offer built-in support for periodic updating of data obtained from remote data sources.

Different data providers may broadly differ in their flexibility w.r.t. data integration and mapping facilities. While providers for the integration of Linked Data sources (such as the [[ Help:RDFProvider | RDFProvider ]]) merely require the specification of the location of an RDF data sources, providers for integrating data from custom data formats (such as the [[ Help:XMLProvider | XMLProvider ]]) may come with a mapping language that allows users to set up user-defined mappings from XML to RDF. Other providers, such as the [[ Help:ScriptProvider | ScriptProvider ]], offer an even higher degree of flexibility, allowing the user to connect to arbitrary data sources using any groovy script, supporting the data mapping process with built-in libraries for data mapping and manipulation.

The data providers are an essential part in the data integration process offered by {{PRODUCT}}, see [[Help:DataOps]] for details.

Note that, while this section focuses on the setup and use the data providers that are shipped with the {{PRODUCT}} platform out-of-the-box, there is also a [[Help:ProviderSDK|Provider SDK help]] describing how to write custom data providers. Before describing the different provider types in detail, we will provide some general information about how to set up new data providers.

=== Provider Management UI ===

On [[Admin:Providers]] all available providers can be managed and configured. All configured providers are listed in tables and are categorized by type.

The following actions are available:

* adding / removing / editing a provider
* running a provider
* showing additional details about the provider (e.g. the data of the last run)

=== Adding and Removing Providers ===
Providers can be configured using the [[Admin:Providers | Provider UI]], which is also linked from the admin area. To add a new provider, simply click on the 'Add Data Provider' button beneath the Providers table. A [[Help:ConfigurationForm|configuration form pop-up]] like the following window will open asking you to choose a provider type and enter the setup information.

All providers comprise general setup information that is summarized in the table below (fields marked with * are required).

{| class="sortable wikitable" 
|-
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| Provider*
| Choose the provider type you want to add from the drop-down box
|-
| Identifier*
| Source name (URI) of the provider
|-
| Schedule*
| Specifies the poll interval in minutes in which the provider is run or a cron expression defining the schedule. For details about cron expressions please refer to the [http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.1.x/tutorials/crontrigger.html crontrigger] documentation. In order to schedule a provider run every day at 3am, 9am, 3pm and 9pm, the following cron expression can be used: 0 0 3,9,15,21 * * ? *
|-
| Target repository
| (Advanced mode only) Target repository to save the provider output. If not specified, the default repository is used.
|-
| Provider data editable
| Allows users to edit the information retrieved by the provider
|}

In addition, it is possible to configure [[Help:PostProcessors| post processors]] to massage retrieved data (e.g., for entitiy reconcilation or alignments).

Depending on the type additional fields might be required. For more details on this see below. Please note that you can instantiate an arbitrary number of providers, e.g. it is possible to add a set of [[ Help:SPARQLEndpointProvider | SPARQLEndpointProvider ]]  providers, each one connecting to another SPARQL endpoint in the web and possibly refereshing its data in different intervals, as needed.

Providers can be edited/removed just as easily:
* By clicking on the edit button at the right hand side of a provider row, one can edit the configuration parameters in
a popup window similar to the one for adding a provider. Please note that, once created, using the edit form you cannot change the type or the ID of the provider anymore (if you want to do so, you need to delete the provider first and create a new one instead).
* Using the delete button at the right hand side of of a provider row you can easily remove the provider. As a response, a popup will appear, asking you to confirm deletion and allowing you to choose whether you want to delete or keep the data that has been gathered by the provider in its last provider run.


<h3>Provider Types</h3>
Different types of providers are shipped by default with {{PRODUCT}}. For every provider there is a separate help section describing the scope and detailed configuration details.

See [[Help:TOC#Help:Providers_Providers| here]] for a listing of the providers.
