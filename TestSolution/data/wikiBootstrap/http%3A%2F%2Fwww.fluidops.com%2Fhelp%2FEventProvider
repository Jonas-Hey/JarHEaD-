=== Event Provider ===

==== Functionality ====

Creates events based on the results of a SPARQL query.
Events capture a description, timestamp of detection, a classification,
as well as a link to the resource where the event was observed.
Users can view the generated events on dashboards ([[Admin:Events]] and [[System:Event]] for eCloudManager).

{{#widget: com.fluidops.iwb.widget.DisplayConfigurationWidget
