=== Multi Column Post Processor ===

{{PRODUCT}} ships a post processor for tokenizing literals.

You must specify the RDF property which
links to literals which are to be processed. For instance, if the provider gathers email addresses, 
the property "example:email" is to be examined.

Furthermore, a delimiter can be added. The default delimiter is a comma.

==== Example ====

Consider as an example that you want to tokenize a literal "alice@ex.org, bob@ex.org":

<source>
sourceProperty = example:email
</source>

This replaces the statement (:x, example:email, "alice@ex.org, bob@ex.org") with two new statements:
(:x, example:email, "bob@ex.org") and (:x, example:email, "alice@ex.org").


Let's assume the literal contains a list of projects "1, 2". Projects are resources
&#60;http://ex.org/prj/1&#62; and &#60;http://ex.org/prj/2&#62; respectively:

<source>
sourceProperty = example:prj
targetNamespace = http://ex.org/prj/
</source>

The resulting statements are:
(:x, example:prj, &#60;http://ex.org/prj/1&#62;) and (:x, example:prj, &#60;http://ex.org/prj/2&#62;).

If "targetClassUri" is set in addition:

<source>
targetClassUri = foaf:Project
</source>

the project URIs are also typed causing the following statements to be added also:

(&#60;http://ex.org/prj/1&#62;, rdf:type, foaf:Project) and (&#60;http://ex.org/prj/2&#62;, rdf:type, foaf:Project).
