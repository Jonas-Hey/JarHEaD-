= Licensing =

This page documents the license mechanism of {{PRODUCT}} and explains the required license items per product.

== License Management ==

License management can be done from the [[Admin:License]] dashboard. On the dashboard it is possible to load and unload license files, and moreover check the licensing status of the system. 

The process of downloading the latest software, obtaining a license and installing the license is documented in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzgK8mO7-_k">video</a>.

=== Available actions ===

* '''Reload license information:''' By pressing the "Reload" button, all license information within the license repository will be re-read and all requested licenses will be reprocessed. This will have to be done when license files are manually added to the license repository.
* '''Remove all licenses:''' Pressing the "Remove all licenses" button will delete all license files from the license repository and all required licenses will get unlicensed immediately. Use this to reset the licensing and start over again afterward with adding license files again. '''CAUTION: All license files in the license repository will be deleted! Please make backups before removing them, if you have not done so already!'''
* '''Upload license file:''' Before uploading a new license ensure to remove the old ones by using the previous step. Select the "Browse" or "Choose file" button to upload any license file. The license file will be validated during the upload and automatically inserted into the license repository. After a successful upload, the requested licenses will be re-computed to reflect the new license information.

== License Checks ==

The license checks that are performed depend on the actually installed product and modules. A product and/or module defines the type of license required, as well as the number of licenses per item. The license status of each required feature of the current installation is displayed on [[Admin:License]]. In addition, there is a license warning banner visible on each page.

The product and its modules can be tested in a ''trial period''. If this period is over, the system may deactivate certain functionality, e.g. certain functionality is no longer accessible from the menu.

60 days prior to the expiration of a trial license, the user will be informed about this to have enough time to get full licenses. After a trial license expires, a certain grace period will be given until the unlicensed feature will be disabled completely.

== Requesting a license ==

To request your trial or developer license or to manage and access your existing licenses go to our [http://appcenter.fluidops.net AppCenter]. 

For requesting a license it is recommended to provide a screenshot of the [[Admin:License|license status table]] of your installation.
