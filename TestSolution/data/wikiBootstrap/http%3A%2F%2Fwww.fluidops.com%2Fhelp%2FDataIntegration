= Data Integration and Management =
As a platform for application development on top of Linked Data, the {{PRODUCT}} provides a variety of features for importing and exporting data. This includes both support for the integration of data that is already present in Linked Data formats (such as RDF and OWL) as well as the integration of data from non Linked Data formats and systems, including relational databases, XML, and legacy systems. The links listed in the table below provide the required entry points for all data management related topics.

|-
| [[Help:RDFImport | Importing RDF data]]
| Learn how to import RDF data from various sources, such as files, Open Refine projects or remote repositories.
|-
| [[Help:DataOps | Integrating data sources]]
| Data can be easily integrated from external data sources using a three-step process: (1) configure a data source, (2) specify a mapping to transform the data, (3) add optional post-processing steps to improve linking with existing data.
|-
| [[Help:Providers | Using data providers]]
| Data providers allow the periodic integration of external or remote data sources through specialized connection mechanisms. This is an advanced topic. Use manually configured data providers only if regular integration with data sources does not suit your use case.
|-
| [[Help:PostProcessors | Data post-processing]]
| Post Processors are a means for modifying the output of a data provider run, e.g. as part of the three step data integration process.
