=== DateTime Post Processor ===

The DateTime post processor transforms imported date and timestamp information from a specified format into xsd:dateTime format.

[[Help:DataOpsPostProcessing | Post processors]] are used as the last processing step in the three-step data integration process of {{PRODUCT}}.
The xsd:dateTime format is the most generic [http://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_dtypes_date.asp date format used in RDF] for time stamps of any kind.

Data must be imported (e.g., from a tabular data source) by a provider.
This post processor will transform date values in imported triples with a specified property and according to a specified format.
The post processor therefore requires that all values of that property follow the same input date format.
Any imported triples of the specified property with values that do not conform to the specified input date format will be dropped.

For instance, it may transform date values for property "my:date" with input format "MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss" (i.e., triple ''my:StartTime my:date '12/31/2015 16:20:00' '' would be transformed into ''my:StartTime my:date '2015-12-31T16:20:00.000+00:00'^^xsd:dateTime'').
In the case of this example, any triple with a date that does not conform to format "MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss" (e.g., "Dec 31, 2105 at 16:20") would be removed.

Input date formats are specified using Java Date syntax. For a full list of pattern special characters and various examples, see [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html here].
