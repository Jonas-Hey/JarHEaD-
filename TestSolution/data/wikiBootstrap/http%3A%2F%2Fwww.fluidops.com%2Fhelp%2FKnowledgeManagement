= Collaborative Knowledge Management =

{{PRODUCT}}'s user interface is based on a semantic wiki which closely follows the MediaWiki syntax. Similarly to other wikis it can be used for collaborative knowledge management and organization of information. However, with the powerful tools and functionality under the hood many more things can be accomplished.

In this section you will learn about:

*[[Help:IWBMenu | the Information Workbench menu]]
*[[Help:Views | the {{PRODUCT}} user interface]]
*[[Help:Personalization | personalizing {{PRODUCT}}]]
*[[Help:Wiki | using the semantic wiki]]
*[[Help:TripleEditor | authoring semantic data]]
*[[Help:Reporting | exporting views]]
