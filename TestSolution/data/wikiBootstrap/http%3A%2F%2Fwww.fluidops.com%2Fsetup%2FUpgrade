__NOTOC__

= Welcome to your upgraded {{PRODUCT}} installation =

This page will guide you through the recommended post-upgrade steps for your {{PRODUCT}} installation. 

When you are done with the changes, revert to the <a href="/" title="Default Home page">default Home page</a>

{{#widget: CodeExecution | 
 args = {{ true }}
 | confirm = 'Do you really want to revert to the default Home page?'
 | method = 'resetStartPage'
 | passContext = true
 | label = 'Revert Home page'
 | onFinish = ''
 | clazz = 'com.fluidops.iwb.util.UIUtil'
}}


== Check Configuration after an Upgrade ==

Some configuration parameters may have been added. To review your configuration and check added or updated
configuration parameters, go to the [[Admin:Config|configuration page]].


{{#ifexpr: {{#sparql: Java:com.fluidops.iwb.util.SSLSetup#isTrustStoreUp2Date}} | 
  <!-- up 2 date -->
 | <span style="color: red;">Your API truststore seems to be out-of-date and does not contain the latest root certificates. Please either use the bundled original ''fluidops.ca'' trust-store or follow the instructions [[Help:SSL_HowTo| here]] to create/upgrade your custom trust store.</span>
}}

== Updated Wiki Pages and Templates ==

Some wiki pages or page templates may have been updated with the last installation package. 
Whenever a user edits a page, the resulting edited version is always preferred to any "default" page shipped with an installation packages.
In other words, user edits "mask" shipped Wiki pages, and as a result you might be missing out on new functionalities that have been shipped with the latest installation package.

The shipped wiki pages and templates that are masked by user edits are the following:

{{#widget: com.fluidops.iwb.widget.admin.WikiManagementWidget
 | filter = USERPAGES_SHADOWING_BOOTSTRAP
 | visibleFilters = {{ USERPAGES_SHADOWING_BOOTSTRAP }}
 | visibleControls = {{ RESTORELATESTREVISION }} 
 | asynch = true
}}

To discard your local changes and restore the shipped template, select the Wiki page on the list above and click on ''Restore latest bootstrap''.
Your local changes in these pages will be replaced with the version from the latest installation package.
Feel free to try out the new Wiki pages: your local changes will still be accessible under the ''Revisions'' tab. 

See [[Admin:WikiManagement|Wiki Management]] for additional options to manage local edits and shipped templates and pages.

== User Management ==

{{PRODUCT}} supports to store hashed passwords for local users. The following control element element allows to convert encrypted passwords to hashed passwords. See also [[Help:UserManagement]] for details.

{{#widget: CodeExecution | 
 confirm = 'Are you sure you want to convert all encrypted passwords to hash password (note: this cannot be undone)?'
 | method = 'convertEncryptedPasswordsToHashes'
 | passContext = false
 | label = 'Convert'
 | onFinish = 'reload'
 | clazz = 'com.fluidops.iwb.user.IwbPwdSafe'
}}


== Wiki Diagnostics ==

In the new {{PRODUCT}} release, the syntax of some widgets might have changed.
The [[Admin:WikiDiagnostics|Wiki Diagnostics page]] provides an overview of all broken widget definitions.

== Recreate Keyword Indices ==

After an upgrade, the indices for keyword search have to be recreated. This might take some time, so the recreation must be triggered manually.

Recreate the keyword index for structured data:

{{#widget: com.fluidops.iwb.widget.CodeExecutionWidget 
| label = 'Recreate keyword index'
| clazz = 'com.fluidops.iwb.service.IndexService'
| method = 'updateKeywordIndex'
}}

Recreate the keyword index for Wiki pages:

{{#widget: com.fluidops.iwb.widget.CodeExecutionWidget 
| label = 'Recreate Wiki index'
| clazz = 'com.fluidops.iwb.service.IndexService'
| method = 'updateWikiIndex'
}}
