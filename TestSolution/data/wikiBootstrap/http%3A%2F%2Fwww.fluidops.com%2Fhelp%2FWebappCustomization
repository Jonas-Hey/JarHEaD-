== Webapp Customization ==

In this section we describe the possibilities for extending the web application of {{PRODUCT}}.


=== Additional files & images ===

Additional files (e.g. images, java scripts, plain html pages, ...) can be placed inside the ''webapps/ROOT/'' folder of the app. At installation time the directory structure below the ''webapps'' folder is copied from the app into {{PRODUCT}}'s working directory.

'''Note:''' it is best practice to keep the app name as part of the folder structure, e.g.

<pre>
webapps/ROOT/images/myApp/logo.png
webapps/ROOT/myApp/myPage.html
</pre>

=== Custom CSS ===

Apps can customize the appearance of the UI by providing a ''webapps/ROOT/extensions.css'' file.  At installation time this file is copied to ''webapps/ROOT/extensions/css/%solutionName%.css'' and made available to the platform UI. See also [[Help:UICustomization]] for details.

=== Webapp configuration ===

Often apps have the requirement to extend the webapp configuration (e.g., by defining an additional servlet mapping). {{PRODUCT}} supports this by means of Servlet 3.0 web fragments:

Inside an app, developers may place a ''webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web-fragment.xml'' file which at installation time is deployed as ''webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/%solutionName%-fragment.jar''. When the application server finds such fragment jar inside ''WEB-INF/lib'', the respective configuration is applied.

Example web-fragment.xml:

<pre>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

<web-fragment>	
	<servlet>
	    <servlet-name>testBootstrap-helloWorld</servlet-name>
    	<servlet-class>test.server.HelloWorldServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>testBootstrap-helloWorld</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/helloWorld/*</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
</web-fragment>
</pre>
