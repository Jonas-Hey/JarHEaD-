=== Database Snapshot Provider ===

This provider allows creating a snapshot of statements that are interesting to keep track of. The statements
can be identified either by specifying the properties (in this case all statements ?,prop,? are collected)
or by specifying a query. The query can either be a construct query or a select query in the form described by
the [[Help:FormulaProvider]]. In order not to create duplicate statements in the main repository,
it is strongly recommended to use the history repository in order to store the provider's data (choose advanced mode
in the setup dialog and choose target repository = history). This provider is usually used in conjunction
with the [[Help:ChangeHistoryPostProcessor]] which allows logging changes in the important data to a separate datasource or log file.
Note that the logging setup can also be moved to a second
tier. The repository setting allows specifying a remote
system whose data is to be snapshotted. If the log
is written to a central DB accessible to both nodes, both
systems can display the log results. Note that the provider
sets up a simple log table. If a certain index structure
is to be used, make sure to define the table as follows
create table log(subject varchar(255),predicate varchar(255),
object varchar(255),
ts timestamp,
status varchar(255),
reason varchar(255)) and define any index structure on this table.
Also note that the system only appends and reads the information.
No archiving is performed automatically.
