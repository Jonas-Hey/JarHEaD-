==== Graph Data Source (Graph) ====

Graph data sources are a type of [[Help:DataSources | data source]] that access information, which is already available in graph form.

Currently, however, the only graph based data source available out of the box is for RDF data.

You may use this data source to access and import RDF from files or from a URL and create a provider that will update the information on a regular basis and may include [[Help:DataOpsPostProcessing | post processing]] steps for interlinking the imported data.
For importing RDF data just once and without the need for post processing, however, normal [[Help:RDFImport | RDF import]] is generally the better option.
