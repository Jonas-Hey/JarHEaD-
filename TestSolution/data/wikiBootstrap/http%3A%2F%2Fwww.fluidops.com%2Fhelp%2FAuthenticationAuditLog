== Authentication Audit Log ==
For the purpose of keeping track on which users log in into {{PRODUCT}} there are two special loggers that can be activated:
* login.cache
This logger keeps track of authentications matched against cached user entries. If there is no cached entry available for a specific user, this logger has no output.
* login.chain
This logger keeps track of authentications whenever there is no cached user entry available, yet. In case of a cached entry for a specific user, this logger has no output.
* login.failed
This logger keeps track of failed authentications.

Everything that is logged by one of these loggers is written to ''logs/authentication.log''.
Be aware, that every kind of login is tracked, i.e. interactive user login, API login (both REST and RMI) as well as SPARQL endpoint access. This also means, there will be many log entries when using Basic Authentication for the REST API or SPARQL endpoint, as each and every single request will be logged.

By default, all these loggers are set to log level ''INFO'' in which case they don't output anything. In order to activate one of the loggers temporarily (lasts until the service is restarted) they can be set to log level ''DEBUG'' on the [[Admin:Logging|Log Management]] page. For a permanent activation, the lines in ''etc/log4j.properties'' have to be adjusted as follows:
<source>
log4j.logger.login.cached=INFO, login
log4j.logger.login.chain=INFO, login
log4j.logger.login.failed=INFO, login
</source>
Need to be changed to
<source>
log4j.logger.login.cached=DEBUG, login
log4j.logger.login.chain=DEBUG, login
log4j.logger.login.failed=DEBUG, login
</source>
