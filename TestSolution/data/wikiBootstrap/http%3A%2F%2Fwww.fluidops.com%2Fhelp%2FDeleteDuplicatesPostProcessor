=== Delete Duplicates Post Processor ===

{{PRODUCT}} ships a post processor for deleting duplicate statements.

You must specify the RDF property which
links to literals which are to be processed. For instance, if the provider gathers email addresses, 
the property "example:email" is to be examined.

Furthermore, you can specify whether the current provider is a primary or a secondary source: isSecondarySource.

'''Important:''' Due to the nature of the applied detection algorithm this post-processor should only be used for small and medium-sized datasets.

==== Example ====

Consider as an example that your provider generates the following statement: (:x, example:email, "alice@ex.org").
Furthermore, let's assume that the same statement is already present in the database (e.g. manually added by the user).
Consequently, the statement would normally be duplicated, indicating that both the user and the provider state that
x's email address is alice@ex.org. Sometimes, this information is important. In other cases, this is not desirable
and can be avoided using this post processor:

<source>
sourceProperty = example:email
isSecondarySource = false
</source>

In this case, {{PRODUCT}} checks the database for this statement. If another source
already contributed this statement, the statement is removed by the post processor before it
is added into the database. Consequently, the database would only contain the information about x's
email address stated by the user.

Sometimes a datasource is deemed to be unreliable and is only to be used in cases where
noone else can make statements on the matter. Let's assume x's email is specified as bob@ex.org
in the database and let's assume the statement comes from another (trusted) provider.
y's email, on the other hand, is currently unknown to the database. Let's also assume
that the provider generates two statements:
(:x, example:email, "alice@ex.org") and (:y, example:email, "john@ex.org")

<source>
sourceProperty = example:email
isSecondarySource = true
</source>

The post processor filters (:x, example:email, "alice@ex.org"), because x's email is known
to be bob@ex.org and this information is preferred over our unreliable source.
The post processor retains (:y, example:email, "john@ex.org"), since unreliable information
in this case is better than no information.
