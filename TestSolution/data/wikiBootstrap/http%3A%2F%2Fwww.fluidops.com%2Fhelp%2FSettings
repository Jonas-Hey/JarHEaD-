== Chart Settings Files ==

=== Example Settings Files ===
This page gives an overview of the setting files that can be used to customize available types of charts or serve as examples for creating new settings files:

* [[Help:SettingsGallery|Settings files for Bar, Column, Line, Radar and Pie Charts]]
* [[Help:STOCK-settings|Settings files for STOCK charts]]
* [[Help:MAP-settings|Settings files for MAP charts]]

=== Default Settings Files ===

A corresponding default settings file will be taken for a chart if no explicit settings file is defined. They can be edited only with caution since all charts in the system with no settings file will be affected.

* [[Settings:barchart.vertical.default]]
