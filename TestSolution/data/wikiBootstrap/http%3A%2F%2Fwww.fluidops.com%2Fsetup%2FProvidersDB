= Using a separate repository for providers output =

Sometimes the data providers take a long time to write their output data into the triple store. This may cause problems for some user operations involving explicit or implicit write operations with the main repository due to the write lock contention: for instance, when editing the data using the triple editor, creating data using an instance creation widget, or navigating a wizard. 
To overcome this, one can use a special federation setup, in which separate physical triple stores are used for maintaining user and provider data, and the default repository represents a federation over the two. 

This page helps to configure the {{PRODUCT}} to use such federated setup.

=== 1) Creating and registering the provider data repository ===

In the first step, the physical repository which will be used for writing the provider data has to be created and registered in the system. 
This can be done using the [[Admin:RepositoryManagement|repository manager]] of the {{PRODUCT}} with the following steps. 
# Open the [[Admin:RepositoryManagement|repository manager]]
# Configure a new repository (e.g., ''providersdb'') to be used for data providers output. Note: this repository must allow writing (e.g., a native store).

=== 2) Configuring {{PRODUCT}} to use a specific repository for data providers output ===

Apply the following configuration:

<source>
# Enable a federated setup with a separate repository for providers data
repositoryType=class=com.fluidops.iwb.repository.providerswrite.ProvidersWriteRepositoryFactory
# Specify the repository manager ID of the repository to be used for providers output.
# Should be the one which was created at the previous step.
providerRepository=providersdb
</source>

You can use the configuration form below to configure these settings at runtime (* ''only visible when logged in with respective permissions'').

{{#widget: com.fluidops.iwb.widget.admin.InlineConfigurationWidget | 
 configOptions = {{ 'repositoryType' | 'providerRepository' }}
}}

=== 3) Restart the {{PRODUCT}} ===

Restart the {{PRODUCT}} to apply the new configuration.
