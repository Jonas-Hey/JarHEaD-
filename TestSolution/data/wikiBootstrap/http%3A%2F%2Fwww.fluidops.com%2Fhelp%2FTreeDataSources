==== Tree Based Data Source (Tree) ====

Tree data sources are a type of [[Help:DataSources | data source]] that access information stored in a tree based format.
This comprises, among others, all sort of XML files.

===== List of Tree Data Sources =====

The following tree data sources are available out of the box:

* '''XML''' for XML files of any kind.
* '''JSON''' for data provided in JSON format.

===== Integration Process for Tree Data =====

In the [[Help:DataOps | three-step process]] of data integration, you first create a [[Help:DataSources | data source]] and choose the appropriate type from the dropdown (any of the data sources listed above).

Complete configuration and save the data source.
You need to specify of your data, which can be a file on the server or a URL.
Alternatively, you may upload a file to the server.
If your data allow access only when authenticated with a username and password, enter your credentials in the authentication section.
You may specify encoding options in the advanced section.

When the data source is saved, you can create mappings that transform its data into RDF.
Tree data sources require [[Help:XmlMappings | XML mappings]], as all tree data is internally viewed as XML during the integration process.
The data source can then be accessed by a [[Help:Providers | data provider]] using those mappings.
