= Information Workbench Menu =

Information Workbench has a customizable menu, which is located on the left-hand side. There is an additional menu in the right sidebar, which provides some links and functions.

== Main Menu ==

By default, the left-hand side menu of the IWB, only contains the ''Home'' menu item, which provides a link to the Information Workbench start page. See [[Help:MenuExtensions]] for instructions on how to add additional menu items.

The following image shows the right sidebar. Note that visibility of the menu items depends on the permissions of the user.

=== Search ===

This function provides a full text search. The search field as well as the results are displayed directly in the side bar. See [[Help:Search]] for a general description of search options.

=== SPARQL ===

The SPARQL endpoint allows advanced users to perform queries on the structured data in the Information Workbench. See [[Help:SPARQLEndpoint]] for more details.

=== Events ===

Events are created and categorized based on specific rules, e.g. using using the [[ Help:EventProvider|Event Provider ]] or the [[ Help:SystemHealthProvider|System Health Provider ]]. There are three event categories: ''Error'', ''Warning'' and ''Info''. Each of these categories is shown in a different tab in the sidebar. The total number of events is shown above the ''Events'' icon. 

The ''All Events'' button at the bottom of the sidebar links to the [[Admin:Events|Events]] page.

=== Settings ===

The settings page contains links to various configuration pages. The following table provides links to the different configuration help pages.
