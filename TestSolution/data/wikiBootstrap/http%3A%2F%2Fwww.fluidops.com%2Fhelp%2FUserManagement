== User Management ==

=== User Concept ===
The {{PRODUCT}} basic user concept builds upon different roles (=user groups), including ''admin'', ''user'', and ''guest'' user. The access rights of the user groups is predefined (yet can be flexibly changed, and new roles can be added on demand). In the following we describe the default semantics of the three main roles in more detail. For a full list of available platform roles see [[Help:PlatformRoles|here]].

==== User Role "admin" ====
Admin users have full write access to every page, are allowed to enter the administration area (where they can for instance create new users and specify their roles, upload data, etc.). They have full access to all the widgets, API, and other system functionalities. 

==== User Role "user" ====
Default users have full access rights except that they are not allowed to enter Admin pages and use admin-specific widgets. They are thus not able to create new users and assign roles to them. Further, they are not allowed to use the CLI. However, they have full write access to (non-admin) wiki pages, where they can embed widgets, add semantic links, and author data.

==== User Role "guest" ====
Guest users, a group that is typically assigned to users that are not logged in (see below), have only read access to wiki pages. This means they are not allowed to edit Wiki pages and see/use widgets or views that allow to manipulate the underlying data, but instead are restricted to widgets for view and exploration.


=== Authentication Schemes ===

By default, the {{PRODUCT}} comes with two different authentication schemes.

==== No Authentication Required ====
In the first authentication scheme, user authentication is optional, i.e. users do not need to log in to open system pages. More specifically, users that are not authenticated (i.e., not logged in) are treated as guest users (see the guest role above). Note, however, that users can use the "login" button and manually login when they have a registered user name - e.g. to obtain rights beyond what a guest user is allowed to do.

To enable the latter authentication scheme, you have to set 

<source>
iwbAuthenticationScheme=noauth
</source>

in the file ''config.prop'' in the top-level directory of the server's {{PRODUCT}} installation and restart the system (note that this is the default setting).


==== Authentication Required ====
In the second authentication scheme, user authentication is required in order to get access to ''any'' system page, i.e. users are forwarded to the login page if they have not been authenticated before. Once they have logged in, they have access rights according to the role(s) that is/are associated with their user names. To enable the latter authentication scheme, you have to set 

<source>
iwbAuthenticationScheme=auth
</source>

in the file ''config.prop'' in the top-level directory of the server's {{PRODUCT}} installation and restart the system.


=== User Registration ===

==== Self-registration ====
The user registration widget to any wikipage, and fill out the form to register.

<source>
{{#widget: com.fluidops.iwb.widget.UserRegistrationWidget }}
</source>

When a user registers, he is automatically associated to the ''guest'' user group. Note that user self-registration is of course only possible if the user authentication scheme (see previous paragraph) is set to ''noauth'', since otherwise users do not have access rights to the system pages.

==== User Administration ====
In the latter case, the idea is that admins (i.e., users that belong to the admin group) can create, delete, and modify existing users (e.g., promote them to admins) at the [[Admin:UserManagement|user administration page]]. The administration page is shown in the screenshot below:

<img src="../images/help/usrmgmt.png" width="1100px" style="border:1px solid black"/>

The table at the top of the page can be used to create a fresh user, by entering username, password, and group (when using the default groups: ''guest'', ''user'', or ''admin'' - but you can add new groups on demand). In the table at the bottom of the page, existing users can be administered, including tasks such as deleting user accounts, and changing the group or password of users. Note that a user can be associated to several groups. The group field is automatically populated with the groups known to the system.

==== User to Wiki Synchronization ====

The button "Synchronize all local users to the Wiki", automatically registers and runs a provider which creates 
RDF statements about the users of the system. In this case, the user table hyperlinks to the user homepages.
This mechanism can be used to add additional information such as user phone numbers and email addresses via the Wiki.

==== Bootstrapping an Admin User ====
By default, the system bootstraps an admin account with username ''admin'' and password ''iwb''. It is highly recommended to change the password of the admin user when operating in a global setting, to protect your system (you can do this at the previously described [[Admin:UserManagement|user administration page]]).

If, by mistake, your local admin account was deleted or you reset your password, then you can bootstrap a new admin user by placing a file ''userManagementInit.prop'' in the ''config'' subfolder of your {{PRODUCT}} installation and the restarting the system. This file has to contain username, usergroup, and the associated password. For instance, the file

<source>
user=MyLocalAdmin
pass=MyAdminPassword
group=admin
</source>

will create a user called ''MyLocalAdmin'' (which must not have been a valid user before) with password ''MyAdminPassword'', associated to the group ''admin''. Make sure to write this file with a simple text editor (like Windows TextEdit) rather than word, in order to avoid special characters in the file. Once the system has been restarted the user will be registered, ready for login with the new credentials.
