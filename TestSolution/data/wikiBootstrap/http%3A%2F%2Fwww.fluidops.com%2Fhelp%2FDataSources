=== Data Sources ===

A ''data source'' is a virtual adapter to access external data. It covers basic access only, i.e., extracting the information in its original data model. 

==== Create a Data Source ====

To create a new data source, go to [[Admin:DataSources | Settings/Data Sources]], then choose [[Admin:CreateDataSource | Create New Data Source]].

Then, choose the type of data source that best suits your purpose.

===== Data Source Types =====
There are different types of data sources to read different types of data from local or remote databases, files or other sources.

Data sources are split in three groups, depending on the basic data model of external data:
* '''([[Help:TableDataSources | Table]])''' Data sources that extract information in tabular format, e.g., relational databases, CSV files, etc.
* '''([[Help:TreeDataSources | Tree]])''' Data Sources that extract information organized as a tree, e.g., XML files or JSON.
* '''([[Help:GraphDataSources | Graph]])''' Data sources that extract data that is already in graph format, such as external RDF.

For instance, choose "CSV (Table)" for a CSV file, "JDBC (Table)" for a relational database or "XML (Tree)" for an XML file.

If you are unsure or need further help, please have a look at the complete list of available data sources for
[[Help:TableDataSources | tabular format]], [[Help:TreeDataSources | tree based data]], or [[Help:GraphDataSources | graph data]],
respectively.

===== Configuration Parameters =====
The following example illustrates configuration in a fairly generic case.
Configuration options vary per data source type, though.
At any time you may hover over the "i" icon next to each input field to get instructions on required and optional parameters.

You need to fill in:
# The data source type that you wish to create. This depends on the kind of data you plan to integrate.
# An identifier (alphanumeric, no spaces allowed). Identifiers are used as a name for later reference.
# Connection details (depends on data source type chosen above). For file based data sources, this is the location of the file.  
# Finally, save or preview the data source.

==== Test Connection (Preview) ====
When your configuration is complete, test the connection and validate the input by requesting a preview.

If the preview fails and you do not understand the reason, please refer to the documentation of the data source type you are using ([[Help:TableDataSources | table]], [[Help:TreeDataSources | tree]], or [[Help:GraphDataSources | graph]]).
It may offer more detailed instructions on required configuration, possible dependencies or limitations.

==== Access Data Source ====
Eventually, you may wish to use your new data source.
This happens as part of a three-step process (see [[Help:DataOps | here]] for a general overview).
In a first step, your data source grants access to the information in its raw, original form.
Now, in a second step, you need to add [[Help:DataSourceMappings | mappings ]] to transform the data and possibly and optionally consolidate them in a third step.
When all steps are complete, a [[Help:Providers | data provider]] can automatically access and update information from your data source on a regular basis.

To get started, simply click on "Create New Provider" at the bottom of the page.

<img src="../images/help/DataOps/ds_create_provider.png" style="max-width:1150px; border:1px solid black;" />

A dialog will pop up and ask you to add [[Help:DataSourceMappings | mappings]] (and, optionally, post processing rules), the second and third steps of the data integration process.

<img src="../images/help/DataOps/ds_provider_conf.png" style="max-width:700px; border:1px solid black;" />

Complete the form and add or create a mapping.
When you are done, click "Submit" to automatically store a [[Help:Providers | data provider]] that accesses your data source with the specified mapping and post processing steps on a regular basis.
(If you just wish to add mappings without creating a provider, you may as well close the dialog without submitting, though).

Note, that [[Help:DataSourceMappings | mappings]] look different per data source type.
Again, please refer to the documentation of the data source type you are using ([[Help:TableDataSources | table]], [[Help:TreeDataSources | tree]], or [[Help:GraphDataSources | graph]]) for further details.
