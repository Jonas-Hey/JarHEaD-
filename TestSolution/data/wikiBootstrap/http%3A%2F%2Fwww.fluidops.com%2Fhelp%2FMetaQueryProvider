==== Functionality ====

The MetaQueryProvider identifies a set of target resources by executing a query against the 
specified or default repository. The result of the query must be a list of URIs (i.e., the query must have a single projection). The repository 
against which the query is evaluated can be specified using configuration parameter repository.
The query can be specified in configuration parameter query and either directly contains the
SPARQL query or the name of a named query defined in the [[Help:QueryCatalog| query catalog]]. 

For each returned resource, an instance of the configured provider class is created, configured, and finally executed.  
The target provider is configured using its associated configuration class which is filled by reading 
statements from the target resource.

The provider runs for each target resource are executed in parallel based on the value of config  
parameter parallelRequests. The results of all providers are aggregated and returned. 

==== Example ====

Configure application monitoring

<source>
query = select * where { ?si a :SystemInstance . ?si systemInstance:monitoringActive true }
provider = com.fluidops.iwb.ecm.provider.ApplicationMonitoringProvider
</source>
