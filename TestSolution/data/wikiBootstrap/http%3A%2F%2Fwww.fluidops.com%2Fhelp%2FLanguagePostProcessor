=== Language Post Processor ===

{{PRODUCT}} ships a post processor for providing literal statements with a language tag.

This feature can be used for the following use cases:

* during post processing update all object literals of the statements with a given property such that the literals contain the language
* mapping of multiple columns containing language literals to a single property

'''Example 1:''' Mapping multiple columns to a single property

a) Input data from a tabular CSV file

In this example the CSV table contains a column for the german literal and one for the english translation.

b) Provider configuration with the language post processor

Having created a basic mapping, the corresponding provider configuration including the language post processor looks as follows.

c) Provider run output

The provider produces the statements below and maps the literals to a single property with the URI '':value''. Note particularly that the literals have the appropriate language tag (which can be see for instance in the triple editor).
