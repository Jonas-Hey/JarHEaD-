== Menu Items ==

The table provides a detailed view of the ''Categories'' of the main menu. For each ''Sub Category'' the ''Required Features'', ''Required Products'' and ''License Status'' are shown.

A category or sub category is considered licensed if at least one of the required features or products is either fully licensed or within the trial period. Information on which features are fully licensed and which features only have a trial license can be found on [[Admin:License]].
