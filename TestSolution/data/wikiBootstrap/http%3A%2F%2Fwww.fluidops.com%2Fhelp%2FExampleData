==  Loading Example Data into the {{PRODUCT}} ==

In some help pages we make use of example data to demonstrate certain functionalities such as charts or our template mechanism. The provided example data contains business- and research related data from [http://data.gov.uk/ data.gov.uk] (which is used mainly in the example charts and queries) as well as some abbreviations for geographic regions (which are used for the HeatMap widget). This data is available as a bundled app that can be installed directly from the platform. To follow the examples yourself, please perform the following steps to import the sample data:

# Navigate to [[Admin:Apps | Admin:Apps]]
# Find the line with for the bundled app '''Getting Started''' and click '''Install'''
# A small loader animation appears in the bottom right corner of the browser window. Wait until it terminates and the page reloads. 

After the reload, the data is imported into the installation and you can proceed with the tests. 

In order to find the loaded RDF data in the {{PRODUCT}}, navigate to [[Admin:ContentOverview]] and search for the ''context identifier'' you were using.
