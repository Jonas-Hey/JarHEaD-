=== Graph Explorer Widget ===

The Graph Explorer Widget allows you to visualize, traverse, and search the underlying RDF graph.
While wiki pages and dashboards encode a given view of the data, the graph explorer
can be used to work with the raw data, regardless of whether any visualization is in place yet or not.
Advanced users can also make results of their search process available to other users by saving
the search process.

==== Functionality ====
{{#widget: com.fluidops.iwb.widget.DisplayConfigurationWidget
| clazz = com.fluidops.iwb.widget.GraphExplorerWidget
| type = 'DESCRIPTION'
}}

==== Configuration Settings ====

{{#widget: com.fluidops.iwb.widget.DisplayConfigurationWidget
| clazz = com.fluidops.iwb.widget.GraphExplorerWidget
| type = CONFIGURATION
}}

==== Adding Nodes ====

Nodes can be added either via a query or by adding nodes individually.
If a query is used, all resources of all result columns are added.
Note that initially, only the resources themselves are shown without any links
to neighboring nodes. Also note that graph explorer only visualizes
resources and not literal values such as strings, numbers, etc.

==== Selecting Nodes ====

Nodes can be selected for further operations by either clicking on the node or by selecting 
a type in the table on the left.

==== Viewing Information ====

The main canvas shows nodes and their relationships. In addition, the tables on the left side
display important information also. The first table is activated by clicking on
a node on the canvas. It then shows all incoming and outgoing relationships.
The second table shows which types and how many instances of each type are being displayed currently.
All instances of a type can be selected by clicking the checkboxes.
The third table shows the relationship types and how many lines corresponding to the relationship
type are being shown. 

==== Working with Selected Nodes ====

The buttons expand and remove selected can be used to show additional information and to
reduce the amount of information shown. Expand adds all incoming and outgoing links to other resources
for all selected node. Similarly, the remove action removes all selected nodes and links to and from them.

==== Predicate Blacklist ====

The checkboxes on the predicates table can be used to restrict the amount of
information that is added by search and expansion. First, predicates can be placed on the blacklist.
This means, that they are no longer added by expanding nodes and searching for nodes.
Secondly, predicates can be selected by checking them in the table. This means that only
the selected predicates will be added / searched.

==== Searching ====

The widget comes with two search algorithms. The first search simply traverses all
incoming and outgoing edges from the selected nodes. The second search tries to find
paths between the selected nodes. Both searches are aborted after a couple of seconds and
in case a given limit of statements has been added. This mechanism avoids the canvas getting too crowded.
