=== String Operation Post Processor ===

{{PRODUCT}} ships a post processor for manipulating literals.

You must specify the RDF property which
links to statements which are to be processed. For instance, if the provider gathers email addresses, 
the property "example:email" is to be examined.

The toCase setting allows to specify whether the statement value is to be transformed to upper or lower case.

Finally, the triplePosition determines, whether the statement's subject or the statement's object are to be changed.

==== Example ====

Consider the following statement: (:x, example:email, "ALICE@ex.org")

<source>
sourceProperty = example:email
triplePosition = object
toCase = lower
</source>

This replaces the statement (:x, example:email, "ALICE@ex.org") with (:x, example:email, "alice@ex.org").

In some cases, the capitalization of URIs prohibits matching information from different datasources.
Consider the following example: (urn:ALICE, example:email, "alice@ex.org") (urn:bob, foaf:knows, urn:ALICE).
Let's assume, another datasource uses urn:alice to identify Alice. In order to achieve a match, the following
post processor setting can be used:

<source>
sourceProperty = example:email
triplePosition = subject
toCase = lower
</source>

This changes the statements (urn:ALICE, example:email, "alice@ex.org") (urn:bob, foaf:knows, urn:ALICE)
to (urn:alice, example:email, "alice@ex.org") (urn:bob, foaf:knows, urn:alice).
Note that urn:ALICE also got replaced in the second statement, despite the statement not matching the 
source property.
