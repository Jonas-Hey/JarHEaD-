= Resource Groups =

Resource groups allow to define collections of resources that have a common purpose or that share certain characteristics.

{{#widget: TableResult | 
 query = 'select * where { ?Group a Platform:ResourceGroup }'
}}

You can manage groups on the [[Admin:Providers]] page, for instance by creating a new [[Help:GroupProvider]].
In addition, you can manually create groups and add group members:

{{#widget: InstanceCreation | 
 instanceType = 'Platform:ResourceGroup'
 | title = 'Create a group and manage its members manually'
 | uri = 'http://www.fluidops.com/resource/group/$name$'
}}
